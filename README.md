# Arduino Sensor and Device Modules

## Description
This repository contains various Arduino code modules for basic sensors and devices commonly used in projects. It includes modules for temperature sensors, humidity sensors, voltage measurement, current measurement, real-time clock (RTC), servo motors, LCD displays, and more. Each module provides the necessary code to interface with the respective sensor or device and retrieve relevant data. The repository serves as a convenient resource for Arduino enthusiasts, allowing easy access to code snippets and examples for different sensors and devices.

## Included Modules
- DHT22: Code module for the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.
- DS18B20: Code module for the DS18B20 temperature sensor.
- Load Cell: Code module for interfacing with a load cell for weight measurement.
- 2004 LCD: Code module for interfacing with a 2004 LCD display.
- LCD with I2C: Code module for using an LCD display with I2C interface.
- MLX90614: Code module for the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor.
- PH Sensor: Code module for the PH sensor.
- PZEM004T: Code module for reading electrical parameters using the PZEM004T module.
- RPM Test with IR Proximity: Code module for testing RPM using an IR proximity sensor.
- DS3231 RTC Manual Time Set: Code module for the DS3231 RTC with manual time setting.
- SD Card Access: Code module for accessing an SD card and reading/writing data.
